  "summary": "Diff adds a landing/title page with prominent ANIMEXIS + owner line and an explicit \"Enter Gallery\" button, and switches App to render landing first. However, routing is implemented via internal React state rather than actual URL routes (\"/\" and \"/gallery\"), so the app may not truly open at route \"/\" nor navigate to \"/gallery\" in the browser address bar/history as required.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Make the app open on a dedicated title page at route \"/\" (and not the gallery).",
      "reason": "The app initializes a local `currentRoute` state to '/' but does not implement real URL-based routing; there is no evidence that the browser route/path is set to \"/\" or that direct navigation/bookmarking works.",

      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Proceed from the title page to the existing gallery page at route \"/gallery\" via a clear UI affordance (no scroll gating).",
      "reason": "The title page provides a button that calls `onNavigate`, but navigation only updates local component state and does not change the URL to \"/gallery\" (no pushState/router usage shown).",
